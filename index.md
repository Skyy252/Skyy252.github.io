### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorites because I was introduced to the concept of vectors. Lab 5 part 1 taught me how to structure the boilerplate, vectors as a string of words, and implement them into if statements.


* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorites. Not only did this lab help me understand how to implement different variables and equations, but it allowed me and my partner to use test cases to test the validity of the code.


* Lab 10

    Lab 10 part 3 was one of my favorite labs because it covered the topic of image creation. It was a great way to see how topics such as loops could be used in a program creating an image.
